Compact JWT without OpenSSL
===========================

**☣☣ This fork is maintained by a [solo developer](https://github.com/kikuomax), neither verified nor validated independently.
I highly recommend you use the [original version](https://github.com/kanidm/compact-jwt).**

Json Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular method for creating signed transparent tokens that can be verified
by clients and servers. They are enshrined in standards like OpenID Connect which causes them to
be a widespread and required component of many modern web authentication system.

JWT and Json Web Signature (JWS) however have a long track record of handling issues, which have
led to security issues. This library will not be a complete implementation of JWT/JWS, instead
focusing on a minimal subset that can be secured and audited for correctness more closely within
a limited set of use cases.

When should I use this fork?
----------------------------

If you cannot depend on OpenSSL, this fork might be for you. **Use at your own risk.**

If you wish to create ECDSA signed JWT tokens, or verify ECDSA signed JWT tokens, this library is for you.

If you are implementing OIDC as a relying party or authorisation server, this library is for you.

If you want to use HMAC signatures, have a full JWS implementation, or have the non-compact (JSON)
serialisation support, this library is not what you want.

Why another JWT library?
------------------------

There are already many other libraries for JWT on crates.io however they each have a limitation
or design that conflicts with the project goals in Kanidm. Examples are:

* Incorrect Implementations - There are a number of JWT libraries in Rust that are incorrect to the RFC or do not have RFC vector tests
* ~~Ring as the sole cryptographic provider - we need to use OpenSSL~~ not applicable to this fork
* Only supporting RSA/Weak cryptographic algos - We want to use ECDSA
* Full JWS implementation - As mentioned, JWS has a number of sharp edges like alg=none

As a result, nothing "fit" what we wanted, so we are making another library.
